<h3>About Wild Horses</h3>
    <p>Wild horses, including iconic breeds like the Mustang and Przewalski's horse, are known for their strong social structures and adaptability to harsh environments. Typically found in expansive grasslands and rugged terrains, they form close-knit herds led by a dominant mare. These social bonds are essential for their survival, as they rely on each other for protection and support. Understanding their behavior and habitat needs is crucial for effective conservation strategies that ensure their survival in the wild.</p>
    <h1>Wild Horses</h1>

    <div class="wild-horse">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Wild horses are free-roaming horses that live in the wild, primarily in North America, Europe, and Asia. They are descendants of domesticated horses that returned to the wild.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="wild-horse">
        <h2>Species</h2>
        <p>The most well-known wild horse species is the mustang, which is found in the western United States. Other notable wild horse populations include the Przewalski's horse in Mongolia and the Brumbies in Australia.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="wild-horse">
        <h2>Habitat</h2>
        <p>Wild horses typically inhabit grasslands, deserts, and mountainous regions. They require ample space to roam and graze, as well as access to water sources.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="wild-horse">
        <h2>Social Structure</h2>
        <p>Wild horses live in social groups known as bands, which usually consist of a dominant stallion, several mares, and their offspring. These bands work together to protect themselves from predators.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="wild-horse">
        <h2>Diet</h2>

    </div>

    <div class="wild-horse">
        <h2>Conservation</h2>
        <p>While wild horses are often romanticized, they face numerous challenges, including habitat loss and competition with livestock. Conservation efforts are in place to manage their populations and protect their habitats.The conservation of wild horses, particularly in places like the American West, is a complex and often contentious issue. These horses, often referred to as mustangs, are seen as symbols of freedom but also pose challenges to ecosystems where they roam. Conservation efforts aim to balance the preservation of wild horse populations with the health of the environment.</p>
        <p>Key strategies include establishing protected habitats, implementing population management techniques like roundups and adoptions, and promoting public awareness about the ecological impact of overpopulation. Advocates argue that wild horses are part of the cultural heritage and should be preserved, while others express concern over their grazing habits affecting native flora and fauna.</p>
        <p>Successful conservation requires collaboration among government agencies, wildlife organizations, and local communities, emphasizing sustainable practices that honor both the wild horses and the ecosystems they inhabit. This multifaceted approach aims to ensure that these iconic animals thrive while maintaining ecological balance.</p>
